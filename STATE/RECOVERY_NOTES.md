# RECOVERY NOTES - Synapse

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T16:24:00-05:00
- Wake-up after compaction was completed and reconciled against live GitHub/git/MCP state.
- User's `Issue615FanoutTarget` question was answered and rechecked:
  - no live #615 fixture window or Synapse element is visible now;
  - those windows are old #615 WinForms UIA fanout stress fixtures, not product UI.
- Active issue is #624:
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/624#issuecomment-4596141027
  - open, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
  - live open queue: #594 plus #595-#604 and #624-#634.
- Current git/worktree:
  - branch `main`, HEAD `841679c docs(state): record issue 624 start [skip ci]`.
  - modified files: `STATE/*`, `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/everquest_ui_context.rs`, `crates/synapse-profiles/profiles/everquest.live.toml`, `docs/computergames/05_mcp_tool_surface.md`, `docs/computergames/26_everquest_live_eval.md`.
- #624 implementation patch:
  - EverQuest account/login gate now detects EULA, end-user license agreement, terms/privacy, `I AGREE`, and `I DECLINE`.
  - Action denial reason is `everquest_login_or_account_gate_visible`.
  - Docs describe account/legal gates as non-in-world and raw legal/account text as non-persisted.
- #624 evidence already captured:
  - Isolated repo-built daemon PID `34624`, bind `127.0.0.1:7853`, binary SHA256 `3BA384BF72EC44DC1106235A4809CEDCEBFB056353527FEA57B6D109C14E3AB7`, strict Inspector tools-list 80 tools.
  - EULA/account-gate behavior: real MCP `observe`, `everquest_survival_readiness`, `everquest_chat_input_state`, `act_keymap inventory`, `everquest_loc_probe`, and `everquest_current_state`; denied action/log readbacks prove no gameplay/chat input was sent and EQ log bytes stayed SHA256 `E563074084A7F5A291AC6FBF77746B993AB086F747C6C111C39503B6BF475368`.
  - Synthetic domain/trajectory/episode export already exists; episode export SHA256 `7386a7f8b26cd6fc8e262813eff9167785d13610aaf8e68bbd9fcce3949dc2ef`.
  - ContextGraph ingest/search succeeded through real wired Synapse MCP:
    - ingest row `everquest/contextgraph_ingest/v1/everquest.live/7386a7f8b26cd6fc8e262813eff9167785d13610aaf8e68bbd9fcce3949dc2ef/issue624-synth-trajectory.issue624-synth-consider`
    - fingerprint `d5d91675-9303-4b0f-bdd6-2f0326abffdb`
    - search row `everquest/contextgraph_search/v1/everquest.live/issue624-synth-search-wired-warm`
    - search result/citation count `1`, same fingerprint and export hash.
  - Active safe/read-only storage chain persisted current state, map sensor, four outcome rows, hazard memory, safe-area memory, planner consult, planner guard, route plan, world-model transition, and world summary. Final `storage_inspect` read `CF_KV=33`.
  - Physical SoTs: EQ log length `2464677`, SHA256 `E563074084A7F5A291AC6FBF77746B993AB086F747C6C111C39503B6BF475368`; `maps\nektulos.txt` has `To_Neriak` at line `5974`.
- Captured #624 edges:
  - login/account EULA gate denial;
  - non-EverQuest foreground;
  - synthetic visible unsent chat text guard fail;
  - structurally-invalid planner source ref fail-closed;
  - absent valid-shaped EQ log path fail-closed with no `CF_KV` change;
  - reality audit profile mismatch fail-closed.
- Cleanup and final checks:
  - Real Inspector `release_all` on isolated daemon `127.0.0.1:7853` returned zero held inputs.
  - PID `34624` was stopped; process and port `7853` readbacks returned no rows.
  - Passed: `cargo fmt --check`; focused UI-context tests; EverQuest profile parse test; schema sanitize; tools-list; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `scripts\check_docs.ps1`; release build; `git diff --check`.
  - Release binary SHA256 `31D62B2891F4AA17F7139BF4A5E52276521F7009E7B2C428D6FAFF15CBF5A374`, length `46392320`.
- Exact next steps:
  1. Commit with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Post #624 evidence and mark #624 blocked on the exact operator-only action: operator must personally review/respond to the Daybreak EULA/account agreement and put the character in-world.
  3. Refresh the queue and continue with the next open issue.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T16:02:28-05:00
- Wake-up after compaction is complete and reconciled against actual disk/GitHub/process/MCP state.
- User's `Issue615FanoutTarget` concern was rechecked:
  - no live Issue615/fanout process or Synapse element exists now;
  - foreground is EverQuest;
  - `.runs\615\target\issue615_target.ps1` confirms the buttons are only a temporary #615 WinForms UIA fixture that mutates an in-window `ItemPanel` or closes itself.
- Active issue is #624:
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/624#issuecomment-4596141027
  - open, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`, labeled `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`.
  - live open queue: #594 plus #595-#604 and #624-#634.
- Git readback:
  - branch `main`
  - HEAD `841679c docs(state): record issue 624 start [skip ci]`
  - modified files are the #624 EULA/account-gate patch in `everquest_ui_context.rs`, `everquest.live.toml`, and the two EverQuest docs.
- #624 isolated daemon is still running:
  - PID `34624`, bind `127.0.0.1:7853`
  - binary `.runs\624\eula-guard-fsv-20260601T2034\bin\synapse-mcp-runtime.exe`
  - binary SHA256 `3BA384BF72EC44DC1106235A4809CEDCEBFB056353527FEA57B6D109C14E3AB7`
  - strict Inspector tools-list readback: 80 tools, missing none, all #624 tools present.
- Verified #624 evidence directory:
  - `.runs\624\eula-guard-fsv-20260601T2034`
  - EULA/account-gate guard FSV shows real MCP `observe`, `everquest_survival_readiness`, `everquest_chat_input_state`, `act_keymap`, `everquest_loc_probe`, and `everquest_current_state` calls; separate storage/log readbacks prove actions were denied and EQ log bytes did not change.
  - Synthetic domain/trajectory/episode export rows exist; exported episode file SHA256 is `7386a7f8b26cd6fc8e262813eff9167785d13610aaf8e68bbd9fcce3949dc2ef`.
- ContextGraph next action:
  1. Rerun `everquest_contextgraph_ingest` through the isolated daemon with `no_warm=false`, storage under the data root, wrapper `.runs\issue529\context-graph-mcp-wsl.cmd`, and a long timeout.
  2. If it succeeds, run separate `storage_inspect` and inspect ContextGraph storage directory/file SoTs.
  3. Then run `everquest_contextgraph_search` through real MCP and inspect returned provenance plus persisted search audit rows.
  4. If it fails, inspect the exact child stderr/root cause and continue reversible local setup.
- Operator-only boundary:
  - EQ is visible at the Daybreak EULA/account agreement. Do not click I Agree, I Decline, login, character select, or chat/account fields. Full in-world #624 happy path remains unavailable until the operator personally reviews/responds to the agreement and places the character in-world.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T15:16:27-05:00
- Wake-up after compaction is complete. Required doctrine/state/GitHub/git/MCP context was re-read and reconciled.
- User's `Issue615FanoutTarget` concern was checked:
  - no live `Issue615`/fanout window/process exists now;
  - wired Synapse `find` found no `Issue615FanoutTarget`/`Show80` elements;
  - fixture source `.runs\615\target\issue615_target.ps1` confirms it was a temporary WinForms UIA stress target; buttons mutate the `ItemPanel` or close the form and are not product UI.
- #623 is closed:
  - RESOLVED evidence: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/623#issuecomment-4596117663
  - Closure readback: `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-06-01T20:13:12Z`.
  - Evidence/state commit on `origin/main`: `c4c3b14 docs(state): record issue 623 evidence [skip ci]`.
- Active issue is #624:
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/624#issuecomment-4596141027
  - Claimed with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`.
  - Live open queue: #594 plus #595-#604 and #624-#634.
- Git readback: branch `main`, `git status --short --branch` is `## main...origin/main`, HEAD `c4c3b14`.
- Wired MCP readback: `health ok=true`, active profile `vscode`, operator hotkey registered, storage initialized, `observe`/`storage_inspect`/`reflex_list` returned normally.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Commit/push this state update with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Inspect #624 EverQuest live-integration tool implementations and supporting tests/docs.
  3. Read current host EverQuest/log/map/layout/ContextGraph SoTs.
  4. Build/launch repo-built `synapse-mcp` for #624 and perform official Inspector strict `tools/list`.
  5. Run #624 manual MCP FSV with separate physical SoT readbacks for each tool path and required edge cases.

  - Closure readback: state `CLOSED`, closed at `2026-06-01T19:31:05Z`.
  - State/evidence commit: `9c855fc docs(state): record issue 622 evidence [skip ci]`.
- Active issue is #623 `scenario(stress): audit consent + bundle redaction + replay_record`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/623#issuecomment-4595820271
  - Claimed with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`.
  - Current exact next action: inspect `audit_export_consent_set`, `audit_export_bundle`, `replay_record`, redaction policy/report generation, bundle file output, storage row formats, caps, and supporting tests. Then launch a repo-built isolated daemon for manual MCP FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T14:28:42-05:00
- Active issue #622 has manual MCP FSV, cleanup, and supporting checks complete; no product-code patch was required.
- FSV evidence directory: `.runs\622\authoring-fsv-20260601T1350`.
  - Repo-built daemon was PID `59440`, bind `127.0.0.1:7850`, isolated DB `.runs\622\authoring-fsv-20260601T1350\db`, strict Inspector tools-list count 80.
  - Covered behavior:
    - zero-evidence authoring generate failed closed with no candidate row;
    - real observe/action/replay/reality evidence produced action/observation/event/KV rows and replay SHA256 `61AB2CC29986048235197AA336CCC34B86F9794445683C72223FE53AE6BABC1F`;
    - generate/list/inspect wrote candidate `issue622.accept` proposing `matches.add_exe=["powershell.exe"]`;
    - accept wrote state `accepted` and note, re-accept was idempotent;
    - export wrote 2883-byte accepted bundle SHA256 `D2790BD9118B9DB5790C4B56D382EA3872146688AD7057FA59EA23427AF9E37B`;
    - generate/reject wrote candidate `issue622.reject` with reason `issue622 reject reason`;
    - rejecting accepted, exporting missing candidate, list `limit=0`, malformed candidate id, and over-max `max_audit_rows=10001` all failed closed with storage unchanged;
    - 10000-row boundary used real `storage_put_probe_rows` to grow `CF_ACTION_LOG` `2 -> 10002`, then `profile_authoring_generate issue622.max max_audit_rows=10000` scanned/relevant 10000 rows and wrote a candidate row;
    - `profile_quality_refresh` wrote `profile_quality/v1/issue622.authoring`; separate report readback showed score `21`, sample size `1`, scanned action rows `10002`, relevant action rows `2`, observation rows `2`, event rows `3`;
    - stale edge (`stale_after_ns=1`) persisted stale evidence (`audit_rows_stale=2`, score `0`), invalid quality params failed closed, and a final non-stale refresh restored score `21`.
  - Cleanup completed: `release_all` zero, daemon stopped, port `7850` closed.
- Supporting checks passed: fmt, diff check, MCP check, profile quality tool test, replay record tool test, schema sanitize, m3 tools-list, release build; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp profile_authoring -- --nocapture` compiled but had no matching tests.
- Final release binary SHA256: `236992450A49D3177C1FCBF1D06F567C30CC54AA5F217C1F0D59BFDBADF23E01`.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Commit state update with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Post #622 RESOLVED evidence and close #622.
  3. Refresh live queue.
  4. Take the next open issue unless GitHub state changes.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T13:41:30-05:00
- Active issue #621 has manual MCP FSV and supporting checks complete; no product-code patch was required.
- FSV evidence directory: `.runs\621\registry-fsv-20260601T1324`.
  - Repo-built daemon was PID `58848`, bind `127.0.0.1:7849`, isolated DB `.runs\621\registry-fsv-20260601T1324\db`, official Inspector strict `tools/list` count 80.
  - Covered install with expected digest, digest mismatch, scale 600-row registry import/search/report at `limit=1000`, deterministic export and duplicate import, conflicting import, disable+inspect, second-version install and rollback, rollback with no prior, poison contribution quarantine, >1000 contribution quarantine, malformed import, missing-profile contribution export, and invalid limit.
  - Final storage readback: `CF_PROFILES=617`, `CF_KV=1`, `CF_ACTION_LOG=0`; report scanned 617 registry rows and contribution search found two quarantined contribution rows.
  - Cleanup completed: `release_all` zero, daemon stopped, port `7849` closed.
- Supporting checks passed: fmt, diff check, MCP check, curated registry test, registry report test, package manifest test, schema sanitize, m3 tools-list, and release build.
- Final release binary SHA256: `08FEC90BE80C37B940AF9549335F901A8DACE52863FDA9F7990049F0A4A94890`.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T13:16:11-05:00
- #620 is closed.
  - Commit: `6895746 fix(mcp): apply profile runtime config (#620) [skip ci]`.
  - RESOLVED evidence: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/620#issuecomment-4595282935
  - Closure readback: state `CLOSED`, closed at `2026-06-01T18:15:30Z`.
  - Worktree was clean after push/closure before this state-only update.
- Active issue is #621 `scenario(stress): registry scale - install/search/export/import/rollback, digest, poison quarantine`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/621#issuecomment-4595287040
  - Claimed with `status:in-progress`, `agent:codex`, assigned to `ChrisRoyse`.
  - Current exact next action: inspect profile registry implementation, manifest/schema files, storage row formats, and supporting tests. Then build release and run an isolated repo-built daemon for manual MCP FSV using official Inspector strict `tools/list`.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T13:04:31-05:00
- Active issue is #620.
- #620 implementation is patched locally; manual MCP behavior evidence, final supporting checks, release build, and diff review are complete. Commit, RESOLVED comment, closure, and queue continuation are next.
- Manual FSV run directory: `.runs\620\profile-fsv-20260601T1238-clean`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `61244`, bind `127.0.0.1:7848`, isolated DB, isolated appdata/token, strict official Inspector tools-list count 80.
  - All 29 bundled profiles were activated through real Inspector `profile_activate`; each had separate `profile_list` + `health.subsystems.perception` readbacks matching active profile id, mode, capture target/source, min interval, and cursor setting. #620 title says 30, but live SoT has 29 profiles.
  - Matching foreground PowerShell `observe` read `mode=a11y_only` and `diagnostics.capture_config.source=profile:powershell`.
  - `act_keymap alias=clear` wrote `CF_ACTION_LOG` rows preserving alias `clear`, binding `ctrl+l`, keys `ctrl,l`, backend `software`, and foreground `powershell.exe`.
  - HUD specs are present for EverQuest/Luanti/Minecraft profiles. Live Luanti launched and matched the profile process/window, but host foreground remained PowerShell and mouse focus failed with access denied, so HUD-slot live readback is a documented explained gap under the issue acceptance.
  - Edges covered: unknown profile, same-profile reactivation, app-not-running/foreground mismatch, empty alias, unknown alias, and no bundled empty-keymap profile.
  - Cleanup completed: release_all zero, FSV-owned Luanti/Notepad processes stopped, daemon stopped, port `7848` closed.
- Exact next actions:
  1. Commit with `[skip ci]`.
  2. Post #620 RESOLVED evidence and close #620.
  3. Refresh the live queue.
  4. Take #621 next unless GitHub state changes.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T12:45:00-05:00
- Active issue is #620.
- The user's `Issue615FanoutTarget` concern has been checked: no #615 target windows/processes are currently visible/running. They were only the #615 synthetic UIA target and should not be considered product UI.
- Worktree has an uncommitted #620 patch:
  - M1 `active_capture_config`;
  - `observe.diagnostics.capture_config`;
  - `health.subsystems.perception` mode/capture readback;
  - `profile_activate` and foreground profile resolution apply profile mode/capture as well as action backend resolution;
  - `m3_profile_tools` regression checks activation health and observe mode/capture for a synthetic matching profile.
- Supporting checks already passed: core/perception/MCP checks, `m3_profile_tools`, core snapshots observation shape, perception regression, MCP context tests, schema sanitize, and core types.
- Remaining exact next actions:
  1. Run final local supporting checks as needed and `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.
  2. Launch an isolated repo-built HTTP daemon for #620 with `SYNAPSE_DB` under `.runs\620\...`.
  3. Prove process/socket/auth/health/strict Inspector `tools/list`.
  4. Manually FSV all 29 bundled profiles through real Inspector `profile_activate` calls with separate `profile_list` and `health.subsystems.perception` readbacks.
  5. Manually FSV representative matching-profile `observe`, HUD, `act_keymap` + `CF_ACTION_LOG`, and required edge cases.
  6. Post RESOLVED evidence to #620 only after FSV and final checks pass.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T11:54:30-05:00
- #619 is closed.
  - RESOLVED evidence: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/619#issuecomment-4594692386
  - Closure readback: state `CLOSED`, closed at `2026-06-01T16:53:51Z`.
  - No product-code patch was required; final supporting checks/release build passed.
  - Final release binary SHA256: `AF801288800BB64E3DA92B95573F2E9787FE7899AA497E264E7023242D03AB60`.
- Active issue is #620 `scenario(stress): activate all 30 profiles — keymap/HUD/capture/mode apply`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/620#issuecomment-4594697356
  - Claimed with `status:in-progress` and `agent:codex`.
  - Current next action: inspect profile runtime/registry code and bundled profile definitions, then launch a repo-built isolated daemon for #620 manual MCP FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T11:45:17-05:00
- Active issue #619 has manual MCP FSV behavior evidence captured and the isolated daemon has been cleaned up.

  - Repo-built daemon was PID `69600`, bind `127.0.0.1:7847`, isolated DB `.runs\619\gc-concurrent-fsv-20260601T1135\db`, strict Inspector tools-list count 80.
  - Covered behavior:
    - concurrent four-writer fan-in to `CF_EVENTS` (0 -> 320) followed by GC to soft cap 75 while retaining newest tail rows;
    - in-flight/heavy writer of 10000 rows x 2048 bytes followed by GC to 75 while retaining newest `issue619-900-z:9997..9999`;

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T11:18:00-05:00
- Active issue #618 `scenario(stress): storage pressure ladder - 5 levels + write-gating` is patched and manual MCP FSV evidence is captured.
- Worktree patch:
  - `crates/synapse-storage/src/lib.rs`: `Db::pressure_permits_write`.
  - `crates/synapse-reflex/src/storage.rs`: `ReflexRuntime::storage_pressure_permits_write`.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/src/m3/storage.rs`: diagnostic probe writes cover all 11 CFs and fail explicitly with `STORAGE_WRITE_FAILED` under pressure refusal.
  - `crates/synapse-mcp/tests/m3_storage_tool.rs`: supporting pressure-gating regression.
- Manual FSV evidence is under `.runs\618\pressure-fsv-20260601T1108-patched`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `56980`, bind `127.0.0.1:7846`, isolated DB, token `synapse-618-token`, strict Inspector `tools/list` count 80.
  - Initial SoT read: pressure `Normal`, all CF counts 0.
  - Ladder: exact thresholds stayed at the prior level; below thresholds entered L1/L2/L3/L4 with codes `STORAGE_DISK_PRESSURE_LEVEL_1..4`; L2/L3/L4 transitions compacted all 11 CFs; recovery to `Normal` emitted no new code and compacted 0.
  - Gating: L2 accepted `CF_OBSERVATIONS`; L3 refused `CF_OBSERVATIONS`, `CF_OCR_CACHE`, `CF_TELEMETRY`, `CF_MODEL_CACHE`, `CF_PROCESS_HISTORY` and allowed `CF_EVENTS`; L4 refused `CF_EVENTS`, `CF_ACTION_LOG`, `CF_KV`, `CF_OBSERVATIONS` and allowed only `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT`/`CF_SESSIONS`; empty `rows=0` to blocked `CF_EVENTS` no-opped; invalid `cf_name=NOT_A_CF` failed closed; recovery allowed `CF_OBSERVATIONS` again.
  - Separate `storage_inspect` readbacks confirmed the counts: final `Normal`, `CF_EVENTS=1`, `CF_OBSERVATIONS=2`, `CF_REFLEX_AUDIT=1`, `CF_SESSIONS=1`, blocked CFs unchanged.
  - Cleanup: `release_all` zeroed state, daemon PID `56980` stopped, port `7846` closed.
- Final supporting checks passed: `cargo fmt --check`; `git diff --check`; `cargo check -p synapse-storage -j 2`; `cargo check -p synapse-reflex -j 2`; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `cargo test -p synapse-storage pressure -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --test m3_storage_tool -- --nocapture`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp schema_sanitize -- --nocapture`; `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`.

  - Live queue after #616 closure: #594 plus #595-#604 and #617-#634.
  - #617 requires manual MCP FSV of `storage_put_probe_rows`, `storage_inspect`, and `storage_gc_once` against isolated CF row/size SoT under storage pressure and eviction edges.
- Current next action: inspect storage tool/cap/GC implementation and supporting tests, then launch a repo-built isolated daemon for #617 FSV.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T10:12:14-05:00
- Active issue #616 has implementation, manual MCP FSV evidence, cleanup, final supporting checks, and diff review complete; commit, RESOLVED comment, close, and queue continuation are next.
- Patch in `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs` makes `reality_audit` classify concrete compact-state drift instead of treating every physical mismatch as generic `rebase_required`.
- FSV evidence is in `.runs\616\audit-fsv-20260601T0945`:
  - repo-built daemon PID `80292`, bind `127.0.0.1:7844`, isolated DB, strict Inspector `tools/list` with 80 tools;
  - source unavailable/missing baseline wrote `reality/audit/v1/chrome/audit-01780325611288876400-0000000001`;
  - baseline+delta+no-drift wrote two delta rows and audit `...0000000002` with `in_sync`;
  - minor title drift wrote audit `...0000000003` with `minor_drift`;
  - immediate rebase audit wrote audit `...0000000004` with `in_sync`;
  - major UI-structure drift wrote audit `...0000000006` with `major_drift`;
  - stale epoch wrote audit `...0000000007` with `rebase_required`;
  - invalid `depth=0` failed closed and left `CF_KV=18`, `CF_ACTION_LOG=14` unchanged.
- Cleanup is done: release_all called, target PID `13676` stopped, daemon PID `80292` stopped, port `7844` closed, no visible `Issue616*` or `Issue615FanoutTarget` windows remain.

- Next exact commands: commit with `[skip ci]`, post RESOLVED evidence to #616, close it, refresh queue.

## Current Resume Point - 2026-06-01T09:39:21-05:00
- Active issue #616 is patched locally but not yet fully verified or committed.
  - Patch in `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs`: `reality_audit` now itemizes drift by comparing the stored head compact state to the fresh captured compact state, classifies field-level severity, distinguishes source unavailable/stale/mismatch cases, and persists changed paths in `RealityDriftItem`.
  - Focused checks passed: `cargo fmt`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp reality_audit_ --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture` (6 passed).
  - Next action: run broader supporting checks/release build, then launch an isolated repo-built daemon for #616 manual MCP FSV.

  - Closure readback: issue state `CLOSED`, closed at `2026-06-01T14:30:47Z`.
- Active issue is #616 `scenario(stress): reality drift injection -> reality_audit rebase`.
  - START comment: https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/Synapse/issues/616#issuecomment-4593554251
  - Live queue after #615 closure: #594 plus #595-#604 and #616-#634.
  - #616 requires `reality_audit` drift verdicts to match physical divergence from the assumed baseline/head epoch/hash and to persist `CF_KV/reality/audit/*` rows through real MCP triggers.
- Current next action: inspect `reality_audit` implementation/tests and plan an isolated repo-built daemon FSV run for drift injection, no-drift, source-unavailable, minor/major boundary, audit-after-rebase, empty/no-change, and invalid params.

## #615 Closure Checkpoint
- Patch: `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs` excludes incidental focus and parent `children_count` changes from the UIA high-fanout coalescing threshold while preserving changed-id metadata on emitted aggregate deltas.
- Manual MCP FSV evidence is under `.runs\615\fanout-fsv-20260601T0844-patched`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `64500`, bind `127.0.0.1:7843`, strict Inspector `tools/list` returned 80 tools.
  - Physical target PID `79124`, title `Issue615FanoutTarget`, separate OS UIA reads confirmed item counts/names after real MCP `act_click` triggers.
  - Covered Show7 per-element, Show8 coalesced, Rename8 `uia_elements_changed`, Mixed8 coalesced, Show80/Clear snapshot-budget rebase with no `CF_KV` row growth, empty/no-change, invalid `depth=0`, and disappear8.
  - Cleanup stopped PID `79124`, stopped PID `64500`, and port `7843` no longer listens.
- Final supporting checks passed: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp server::reality::tests --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture` (17 passed); schema sanitize tests (3 passed); release build; `git diff --check`.

## #614 Closure Checkpoint
- Final supporting checks passed after FSV: `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `cargo test -p synapse-mcp server::reality::tests --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture` (14 passed); `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp schema_sanitize -- --nocapture` (3 passed); `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`; `git diff --check` with line-ending warnings only.

- Main evidence run: `.runs\614\reality-loop-fsv-20260601T0741-patched`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `82340`, bind `127.0.0.1:7840`, strict Inspector tools-list 80 tools, baseline/head rows, 18 total SSE `reality_delta` frames, audit row `reality/audit/v1/unprofiled/audit-01780319054227975800-0000000001`, and cursor/error edges captured.
  - Cleanup stopped PID `82340`, curl PID `82448`, and Luanti PID `36460`; an orphan TCP LISTEN row for `127.0.0.1:7840` still references non-existent PID `82340`, so use a different port if needed.
- FS-watch evidence run: `.runs\614\fs-watch-fsv-20260601T0805`.
  - Repo-built daemon PID `77940`, bind `127.0.0.1:7841`, `SYNAPSE_FS_WATCH_ROOT` set to the run `watch` directory, strict Inspector tools-list 80 tools.
  - Real MCP `act_run_shell` wrote `issue614-fs-watch-marker.txt`; separate file read matched text/hash; `observe_delta` returned `/fs` created-file delta; `storage_inspect` read CF_KV baseline/delta/head rows.
  - Cleanup stopped PID `77940`; port `7841` has only TIME_WAIT rows.

## #614 Patch Checkpoint
- Current worktree change: `crates/synapse-mcp/src/server/reality.rs`.
- Patched:
  - omitted-profile `reality_baseline` now observes first, selects the active profile, and reuses that profile's existing head/baseline when `epoch_id` is omitted and `force_new_epoch=false`;
  - `observe_delta.since_epoch` now validates through the same reality key-segment validation used for baseline/audit epochs before stale-epoch comparison;
  - `capture_reality_observation` now fails closed on `depth=0`, `depth>6`, `max_elements=0`, or `max_elements>500` instead of clamping bypassed invalid values.
  - `observe_delta` now returns `profile_changed` rebase guidance for a known observed profile switch instead of failing requested-profile validation before the edge can be represented.
- Focused checks passed:
  - `cargo fmt`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp reality_baseline_reuses_observed_profile_when_profile_id_is_omitted --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp observe_delta_edges_return_rebase_or_fail_closed --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp reality_tools_reject_out_of_range_snapshot_params --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp observe_delta_reports_profile_changed_for_requested_head_mismatch --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture`
- Broader supporting checks passed:
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp server::reality::tests --bin synapse-mcp -- --nocapture` (14 passed)
  - `cargo fmt --check`
  - `cargo check -p synapse-mcp -j 2`
  - `cargo test -p synapse-mcp --bin synapse-mcp schema_sanitize -- --nocapture`
  - `cargo build --release -p synapse-mcp -j 2`
- Stopped stale pre-patch isolated #614 daemon PID `75352`.
- Release binary: `target\release\synapse-mcp.exe`, length `46350848`, SHA256 `319FC6F5942ABF272EDCCA7A1EEF7970EE7AE0C7CB6A11A515F681B74F6854A1`, timestamp `2026-06-01T12:39:53Z`.
- Host-sensor plan: use Luanti (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\synapse\benchmarks\luanti\engine\5.16.1\luanti-5.16.1-win64\bin\luanti.exe`) for real foreground/UIA/HUD/entity/diagnostics deltas, Notepad/clipboard/filesystem tools for additional physical changes, and `--enable-audio` plus a local sound trigger for audio if loopback initializes.
- Next: launch isolated #614 daemon, strict Inspector `tools/list`, then manual FSV.

## #614 Manual FSV Evidence
- Main run directory: `.runs\614\reality-loop-fsv-20260601T0741-patched`.
- FS subrun directory: `.runs\614\fs-watch-fsv-20260601T0805`.
- Covered feeds:
  - baseline/head: CF_KV baseline/head rows for `issue614-luanti-20260601T0743` and `issue614-luanti-profiled-20260601T0746`;
  - foreground/focus/UIA/HUD/entity/audio/clipboard: 12-delta main cursor walk, CF_KV 3->15, SSE stream seq 1..12;
  - diagnostics: boundary `max_elements=1` changed `elements_truncated=false` to `true`;
  - filesystem: FS-watch subrun `/fs` created-file delta, CF_KV 2->3, file SHA256 readback;
  - audit: `reality_audit` persisted audit row and returned drift/rebase guidance.
- Edge cases:
  - empty/no-change: `since_seq=12` returned `no_changes`, no CF_KV delta rows;
  - missing baseline: `profile_id=missing614` returned `missing_baseline`;
  - stale epoch: old epoch returned `stale_epoch`;
  - profile change: Notepad foreground returned `profile_changed: head profile unprofiled but observed notepad`;
  - future/overflow/malformed/structural invalids: future seq, overflow seq, malformed epoch, and `depth=0` all failed closed.

## #614 Scope
- Goal: prove the delta-first reality model end to end across every sensor feed.
- Required runtime evidence:
  - real repo-built `synapse-mcp` daemon process/bind/auth/health/session/strict Inspector `tools/list`;
  - real MCP `tools/call` triggers for `reality_baseline`, `observe_delta`, `reality_audit`, and event-producing tools;
  - separate SoT readbacks for `CF_KV/reality/baseline/*`, `reality/head/*`, `reality/delta/*`, `reality/audit/*`, `reality_delta` SSE frames, and physical foreground/focus/UIA/HUD/entity/audio/clipboard/filesystem/diagnostics changes where available;
  - happy path plus missing baseline, stale epoch, profile-change mid-walk, future/overflow `since_seq`, empty/no-change, boundary, and structurally invalid params.

## #613 Manual FSV Evidence
- Final run directory: `.runs\613\subscribe-firehose-fsv-20260601T062230-patched`
- Daemon: PID `32356`, bind `127.0.0.1:7839`, repo release binary, isolated DB/watch/log dirs.
- Precondition: process/socket/auth readback passed; unauth `/health=401`; auth `/health ok=true`; official MCP Inspector strict `tools/list` returned 80 tools with #613 tools present.
- One-per-event: subscription `019e82ec-ebf5-7943-884e-03590d0a05f2` delivered exactly 3 frames for `/focused,/clipboard,/fs`; stream/event seqs `1,2,3`; no drops; file and clipboard physical SoTs matched marker `issue613-patched-oneper-20260601T062403456`.
- 8-deep filter: subscription `019e82ee-5d56-72f2-92c0-00e3c4a73063` accepted regex/in_set/exists filter at max depth and delivered only `/clipboard` and `/fs` from four published reality deltas.
- Firehose/backpressure: subscription `019e82ef-c53f-7e13-ae2c-cfea7dbd3ae8`; 5000 known events posted; stats read `ring_len=4096`, `oldest_event_seq=904`, `latest_event_seq=4999`, `dropped_total=904`, `events_dropped_for_subscriber=904`, `lossy_pending=true`; replay had 1 lossy preface and 4096 event frames.
- Edges: depth 9, invalid regex, invalid data path, and bad buffer size rejected through strict Inspector; empty filter All delivered event seq `613000`; subscribe/immediate cancel produced `cancelled=true`, stats 404 after cancel and after matching publish.
- Cleanup: subscriptions cancelled, `sse_subscribers=0`, `release_all` zero, daemon stopped, port `7839` closed.

## Standing Rules
- Re-read `C:\code\Synapse\docs\AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md`, `C:\Users\hotra\Downloads\AICodingAgentSuperPrompt.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `STATE/*` after compaction.
- GitHub Issues are the only coordination surface.
- No GitHub Actions/CI dispatch, waits, or CI-gated claims.
- Commits pushed by this agent must include `[skip ci]`.
- Automated checks/benches are supporting regression evidence only; they are not FSV.
- Missing local prerequisites are acquisition/setup work, not blockers, unless only a specific operator-only hard-to-reverse external action remains.
